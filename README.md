# Tower

A minimal text-based tower defense prototype.

## Gameplay
- Enemies march along a straight path.
- Towers attack the first enemy within range each tick.
- Includes two enemy types: basic enemies and faster, weaker enemies.

## Running

```bash
python game.py
```

The game will print the status of each tick until all enemies are defeated or one reaches the end of the path.
